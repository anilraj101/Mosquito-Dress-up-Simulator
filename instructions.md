# Fullstack Developer Take Home Project: Mosquito Dress-up Simulator

## Scenario

Even mosquitoes deserve a nice day off! Our new app will help to facilitate this, by allowing users to equip mosquitoes with various accessories such as hats, guitars, and juice. We think this app will allow users to explore their playful side while creating humorous and imaginative scenes featuring mosquitoes. Unleash your creativity, raise awareness, and have a good laugh with our unique mosquito dress-up app.

## Instructions

We provided you with a basic template to help you get started. You should already be able to upload a test image and press the prop buttons to add new props to the mosquito. Your task will be to implement dragging functionality, the ability to drag the objects around the canvas. See the requirements below for more details.

For this project, don't use any new libraries or modify any files outside of the components folder. But feel free to do whatever you want to the components folder or even completely rewrite everything if that's helpful to you. The code given is only meant to make it faster to get started, since we want to keep this project to around 1-2 hours of your time.

## Requirements

* When hovering over a placed item in the canvas, the cursor should be pointer
* The placed items should be draggable within the canvas
* while dragging an item, the cursor should be grab
* When clicking a position which has two overlapping items, only move one of them (doesn't matter which one)
